# Noteful Server

This is an Express server for my [Noteful React client](https://github.com/BrianHook1183/noteful) 

## Set up

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Install the node dependencies `npm install`
4. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server `mv example.env .env`

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`
